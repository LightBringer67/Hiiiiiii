      <p><strong>“Why should I respect you? You haven’t done anything to earn it.”</strong></p>

      <blockquote>
        It sounds harsh, doesn’t it? But if you really corner me with that question, I’d probably agree. Because yes, respect is earned.
      </blockquote>

      <p>Still, that doesn’t mean people deserve nothing. Everyone, no matter who they are, deserves at least this much: a basic sense of decency and a chance to be heard.</p>
      <p>You don’t go around being rude to strangers. You talk politely, you listen when they speak, even if you don’t agree. That’s not respect yet. That’s just humanity.</p>

      <h2>What Is Respect, Really?</h2>
      <p>You treat your English teacher respectfully, right? You greet them when you see them, you talk nicely, you nod when they explain something. But then they give you an assignment, say, “Write a blog and post it.” You don’t do it. They extend the date. You still don’t.</p>
      <p>Now think about it. Do you really respect that teacher? Maybe you never disrespected them outright. You never argued or spoke rudely. But what you lacked was something deeper: faith.</p>

      </div>

      <h2>When Someone Makes Sense to You</h2>
      <p>Imagine you’re in a situation where you just can’t figure out what to do. You’ve asked several people for advice, but nothing feels right. Their words sound hollow, rehearsed, or too logical to connect with what you’re feeling.</p>
      <p>And then one person speaks. They don’t say much, but somehow, their words settle in your mind. You can’t fully see what they see, and you don’t completely understand why they said what they did, yet you still decide to listen. You follow their advice, not because it makes perfect sense, but because they make sense to you.</p>

      </div>

      <h2>Faith Is the Seed of Respect</h2>
      <p>That’s what faith looks like. It’s not about knowing the outcome. It’s about trusting the intent. It’s the moment you choose to believe in someone even when clarity hasn’t arrived yet. And that, quietly and simply, is respect in its purest form.</p>

      <p>Because respect isn’t built on fear, formality, or hierarchy. It’s built on belief — on giving someone the benefit of trust before judgment, on having enough faith in their intentions to give their words a chance.</p>

      <h2>Give a Chance, Earn Respect</h2>
      <p>Everyone deserves courtesy, yes. But respect, the kind built on trust, belief, and faith, must be earned. When you meet someone new, you don’t automatically respect them. You give them politeness, the benefit of doubt, and a chance to be heard. Respect follows when they prove that your faith in them wouldn’t be misplaced.</p>

      <p>You can’t truly respect someone without a little faith in their intentions. And you can’t expect respect from others without giving them reasons to believe in yours.</p>

      <p>So maybe the next time you ask yourself, “Do I respect this person?” ask instead, “Do I trust that their actions mean something?”</p>

      <p>Because respect isn’t just about what you say to someone. It’s about what you believe about them. And maybe that’s where it all starts — not with admiration, not with titles, but with something small, quiet, and powerful: giving someone a chance to be heard.</p>
